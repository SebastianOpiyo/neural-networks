## RESEARCH TOPICS
1. Explainable AI:- How to make a model explain its predictions to a user
2. Active Learning:- How to collect training samples optimally
3. Transfer learning:- How to re-use a model trained on tax X on another task Y
4. Multi-task learning:- How to train a single model that accomplishes several tasks
5. Adversarial AI:- How to trick or exploit models for malicious purposes
6. Ethical AI:- How to design an algorithm that recognizes societal biases in their training data
7. Private AI:- How to create models that never disclose private information from their training data

## What to Understand before building models
- Machines can see, hear, talk and they can learn
- Machines do not have common sense, no true thinking(science fiction)
