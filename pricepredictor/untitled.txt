OVERFITTING & UNDERFITTING

#1: What is Overfitting ?
- A scenarion where the machine learning model tries to learn from the details along with the noise in the data and tries to fit each data point on the curve.
- As the model has very less flexibility, it fails to predict new data points, and thus the model rejects every new data point during prediciton
- Reason for overfitting: 
    * Data used for training is not cleaned and contains noise(garbage values) in it.
    * The model has high variance
    * Size of training data is not enough
    * Model is too complex
    

#2: What is Underfitting ?
- A scenario where machine learning model can neither learn the relationship between variables in the data nor predict or claassify a new data point.
    - As the model does not fully learn the patterns, it accepts every new data point during the prediction

- Reason for underfitting: 
    * Data used for training is not cleaned and contains noise(garbage values) in it.
    * The model has high bias
    * Size of training data is not enough
    * Model is too simple

What is a Good Fit
- A line or a curve that best fits the data is neither overfitting nor underfitting models but is just right.


What is the importance of doing data correlation ?
