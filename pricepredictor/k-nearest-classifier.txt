# K NEAREST CLASSIFIER ALGORITHM


1. What is knn?
- KNN - K Nearest Neighbor, is on of the simplest Supervised Machine Learnig algorithm  mostly used for classification.
- It classifies a datapoint based on how its neigbors are classified
- KNN stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure
- A datapoint is classified by the majority votes from its 5 nearest neighbors

2. Why do we need knn ?
- KNN is based on feature similarity. We can use KNN to do classification
- 

3. How do we choose the factor 'K'?
- KNN Algorithm is based on "feature similarity": choosing the right value of k is a process called "paprameter tuning"
and is important for better accuracy.
- To choose a value of K:
    * Sqrt(n), where n is the total number of data points
    * Odd value of K is selected to avoid confusion between two classes of data


4. When do we use KNN?
- When data is labelled
- Data is noise free
- Data is small, because KNN is a "lazy learner", and does not learn a discriminative function from the training set


5. How does the algorithm work?
- A poditive integer k is specified, along with a new sample
- We select the k entries in database which are closest to the new sample
- We find the most common classification of these entries
- This is the classification we give to the new sample
